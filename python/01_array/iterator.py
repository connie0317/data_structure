[iterable]:
1. An object that can be looped over (like a book you know you can read page by page)
2. It must have an __iter__() method that returns an iterator.

[iterator]:
1. An object that does the actual "giving" of items one by one.
2. It must have a __next__() method that gives the next item or raises StopIteration when there are no more items.

The for loop does the following:
Calls __iter__() to get an iterator (in this case, the object itself).
Calls __next__() repeatedly to get the next value.
When there are no more values (when StopIteration is raised), the loop stops.

# You can check if an object is iterable by using the iter() function:
# This will work because the class has __iter__(); If an object doesnâ€™t have __iter__(), Python will raise an error.

1. A function with yield becomes a generator function(a generator function is a special type of function in Python that produces an iterator). 
2. Calling it doesn't execute the function immediately; instead, it returns a generator object.
3. for loops or the next() function can be used to get values from a generator function
